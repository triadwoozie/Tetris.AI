## **Tetris AI Bot Using Deep Reinforcement Learning**

This documentation covers the essentials for developing a Tetris-playing AI bot using deep Q-learning and reinforcement learning principles. We'll detail both the high-level and technical components, ensuring a clear understanding for users with various levels of expertise.

## 1. **Project Overview**

This project leverages reinforcement learning to train an AI bot to play Tetris. By building and training a Deep Q-Network (DQN), the bot can autonomously learn and improve its game performance over time, with the primary goal of maximizing the game score.

---

## 2. **Technical Requirements**

For this project, the following libraries and tools are essential:

- **Python**: Base programming language.
- **Keras/TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks used to build the neural network that powers the DQN.
- **Numpy**: For mathematical operations and array handling.
- **Pygame**: Used to create a playable Tetris environment.
- **OpenCV**: For potential visual processing or screen captures.
- **Tensorboard**: For visualizing and tracking the model’s training progress.

The choice of backend (e.g., JAX, TensorFlow) can influence performance, particularly for operations like GPU acceleration.

## 3. **Overview of Reinforcement Learning in Tetris**

### Key Concepts:

- **Agent**: The AI bot that interacts with the Tetris environment.
- **Environment**: The Tetris game, built using Pygame.
- **Action**: Movement commands (left, right, down, rotate) that the bot can take.
- **Reward**: Points gained by clearing lines, minus penalties for undesirable states.
- **State**: Representation of the Tetris board and current piece, abstracted as input features.

In this setup, reinforcement learning trains the bot to maximize rewards by learning optimal moves for higher scores over time.

---

## 4. **Game Creation with Pygame**

- **Game Board Representation**: The board is represented as a 2D array of binary values, where each cell indicates whether it’s filled or empty. 
- **Piece Handling**: Each Tetrimino piece is represented by a specific shape matrix that the bot can move and rotate within the bounds of the game board.
- **Rules**: Blocks fall continuously, and the game ends when blocks reach the top of the board.

This setup allows us to fully control the game environment and send clear inputs/outputs to the bot for training purposes.

## 5. **Replay Memory for DQN**

### Technical Explanation

**Replay Memory**:
- The replay memory stores past experiences as tuples \((state, action, reward, next\_state)\).
- Memory is implemented as a queue with a fixed capacity, where older experiences are removed as new ones are added.

**Sampling**:
- The DQN agent samples random experiences from replay memory to train the neural network, preventing overfitting to recent states and ensuring diverse learning.

---

## 6. **Designing the Deep Q-Network**

### Deep Q-Learning (DQN) Process:
- **Q-Learning Algorithm**: DQN approximates the Q-value function using a neural network, where Q-values represent the expected cumulative reward of taking an action in a given state.
### Network Architecture:
- **Input**: Encodes features of the Tetris board (like cleared lines, number of holes, bumpiness, height).
- **Layers**: Usually includes fully connected layers with ReLU activations.
- **Output**: Q-values for each possible action, from which the action with the highest Q-value is chosen.

---

## 7. **Training Process and Exploration/Exploitation**

1. **Exploration**:
   - Initial games focus on exploration, where the agent tries random moves to discover effective strategies.
   - **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**: The epsilon parameter controls the balance between exploration and exploitation, gradually reducing as the bot becomes more confident in its learned strategies.

2. **Exploitation**:
   - As training progresses, the bot primarily relies on actions that maximize Q-values.

3. **Rewards and Penalties**:
   - The agent receives rewards for cleared lines and loses points for game-ending states. This incentivizes actions that lead to higher scores while penalizing poor moves.

---

## 8. **Neural Network for Q-Value Estimation**

- **Layers and Neurons**: A typical configuration has 2–3 hidden layers with 32 neurons each. Inner layers use ReLU activations, and the output layer uses a linear activation to provide Q-values for each action.
- **Optimizer**: Commonly, Adam is used for its adaptive learning rate benefits.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is employed to measure the difference between predicted Q-values and target Q-values.

The network learns to approximate Q-values through backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.

---

## 9. **Training the Bot and Observing Learning Progress**

1. **Episode-Based Training**:
   - Each game (episode) is played to completion, with experiences stored in the replay memory.
   - At the end of an episode, the network is trained on a batch sampled from the replay memory.

2. **Loss Reduction**:
   - Loss decreases as the network learns to predict Q-values more accurately, indicating the bot is improving.

3. **Tracking with Tensorboard**:
   - Tensorboard is used to visualize performance metrics such as reward trends, epsilon decay, and loss values over time.

---

## 10. **Testing the Bot’s Performance**

After training, the bot can be evaluated by allowing it to play a series of games autonomously. Key metrics for performance include:
- **Average Score**: Indicates how well the bot has learned to play Tetris.
- **Average Lines Cleared**: Higher values demonstrate improved efficiency.
- **Decision Efficiency**: Lower randomness and more optimal moves over time.

---

## 11. **Choosing the Best Move Based on Q-Values**

1. **State Evaluation**:
   - The bot generates possible future states based on each possible action and uses the neural network to predict the Q-value of each state.

2. **Action Selection**:
   - The bot selects the action with the highest predicted Q-value, ensuring the move is optimal.

This approach differs from many reinforcement learning applications as it evaluates multiple possible states per move, which is feasible in Tetris due to limited action choices.

---

## 12. **Challenges and Improvements**

1. **Training Time**:
   - Deep reinforcement learning can be resource-intensive, with training potentially taking hours or even days depending on setup.

2. **Memory Constraints**:
   - The replay memory size must be managed carefully to prevent memory overload while ensuring sufficient past data is retained.

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - **Larger or Deeper Networks**: Exploring more complex architectures.
   - **Alternative Algorithms**: Testing other reinforcement learning algorithms like Double DQN or Dueling DQN for enhanced learning.

## 13. **Visualization and Analysis of Training Results**

1. **Score Progression Over Episodes**:
   - Plots of scores and lines cleared over episodes provide insight into the bot’s learning curve.

2. **Q-Value Predictions**:
   - Analyzing Q-value predictions over time reveals how well the bot anticipates rewards.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Monitoring epsilon decay helps understand the balance between exploration and exploitation over episodes.

## 14. **Results and Observations**

1. **Initial Training Phase**:
   - The bot starts with low scores and a high level of randomness.
   
2. **Progressive Improvement**:
   - As training progresses, the bot starts clearing more lines consistently and improving its efficiency.

3. **End Results**:
   - After sufficient training, the bot can achieve high scores consistently and demonstrate near-optimal gameplay.
