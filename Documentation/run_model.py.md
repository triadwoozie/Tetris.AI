### Imports
```python
import sys
import time
import pygame
```
- **Purpose:** This section imports necessary libraries:
  - `sys` for handling command-line arguments.
  - `time` for managing timing functions.
  - `pygame` for graphics and user input handling.

### Script Usage
```python
"""
usage: python3 run_model.py sample.keras (copy best.keras to src)

This script runs a pre-trained Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to play Tetris
with the same fall speed as the playable version.

Usage: python3 run_model.py <model_file>
(Example: python3 run_model.py sample.keras)
"""
```
- **Purpose:** Provides instructions on how to run the script, specifying that it requires a model file as a command-line argument to execute the DQN model for playing Tetris.

### Command-line Arguments
```python
if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    exit("Missing model file")
```
- **Purpose:** Checks for the presence of a model file argument. If none is provided, the script exits with an error message.

### Imports and Setup
```python
from dqn_agent import DQNAgent
from tetris import Tetris

# Initialize Pygame for consistent timing
pygame.init()
```
- **Purpose:** 
  - Imports the custom `DQNAgent` and `Tetris` environment classes.
  - Initializes Pygame to manage the game window and timing.

### Environment and Agent Initialization
```python
env = Tetris()
agent = DQNAgent(env.get_state_size(), modelFile=sys.argv[1])
done = False
```
- **Purpose:** 
  - Creates an instance of the Tetris environment.
  - Initializes the `DQNAgent` using the provided model file, setting its state size based on the Tetris environment.
  - Sets a flag `done` to track the game's completion status.

### Timing Setup
```python
# Set up the clock for timing
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
fall_time = 0
fall_speed = 500  # Start with 0.5 seconds (500 ms) per gravity drop
fall_speed_by_level = {
    0: 500,
    1: 450,
    2: 400,
    3: 350,
    4: 300,
    5: 250,
    6: 200,
    7: 150,
    8: 100,
    9: 80,
    10: 50
}
```
- **Purpose:** 
  - Initializes a Pygame clock to manage the timing of game events.
  - Defines variables for tracking the fall time of Tetris pieces and sets the initial fall speed.
  - `fall_speed_by_level` dictionary establishes different fall speeds based on the current game level.

### Main Game Loop
```python
while not done:
    ...
```
- **Purpose:** The loop runs continuously until the game is marked as done (game over). 

#### Delta Time Calculation
```python
delta_time = clock.get_rawtime()
clock.tick()
```
- **Purpose:** Calculates the time since the last frame and updates the clock to maintain consistent timing.

#### Fall Speed Management
```python
fall_time += delta_time
current_level = min(env.level, 10)  # Cap at level 10
fall_speed = fall_speed_by_level[current_level]
```
- **Purpose:** Increments the fall time and adjusts the fall speed based on the current level, ensuring it doesn’t exceed level 10.

#### Piece Falling Logic
```python
if fall_time >= fall_speed:
    fall_time = 0
    next_states = {tuple(v): k for k, v in env.get_next_states().items()}
    best_state = agent.best_state(next_states.keys())
    best_action = next_states[best_state]
    
    # Apply gravity
    _, done = env.play(best_action[0], best_action[1], render=True)
```
- **Purpose:** 
  - Checks if it's time for the Tetris piece to fall based on the fall speed.
  - Retrieves the possible next states from the environment and determines the best action using the agent’s trained model.
  - Executes the action in the Tetris environment and updates the game status.

### Event Handling
```python
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        done = True
```
- **Purpose:** Processes Pygame events to keep the window responsive and checks for a quit event to terminate the game loop.

### Rendering
```python
env.render()
```
- **Purpose:** Renders the current game state on the screen, including the Tetris board and active pieces.

### Clean Up
```python
pygame.quit()
```
- **Purpose:** Properly quits the Pygame environment upon exiting the game loop.
