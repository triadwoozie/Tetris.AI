### Tetris Class Definition
```python
class Tetris:
    '''Tetris game class'''
```
- **Purpose:** This class encapsulates all functionality and data related to the Tetris game.

### Board Constants
```python
    MAP_EMPTY = 0
    MAP_BLOCK = 1
    MAP_PLAYER = 2
    BOARD_WIDTH = 10
    BOARD_HEIGHT = 20
```
- **Purpose:** Constants define the state of each cell in the game board and the dimensions of the board.

### Tetromino Definitions
```python
    TETROMINOS = { ... }
```
- **Purpose:** Defines the shapes of tetrominos with their rotations using coordinates.

### Color Definitions
```python
    COLORS = { ... }
```
- **Purpose:** Maps tetromino types to RGB color values for rendering.

### Initialization
```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.reset()
        pygame.init()
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.BOARD_WIDTH * 30, self.BOARD_HEIGHT * 30))
        pygame.display.set_caption('Tetris')
```
- **Purpose:** Initializes the game state, sets up the Pygame window, and calls the reset method to prepare the game.

### Resetting the Game
```python
    def reset(self):
        '''Resets the game, returning the current state'''
        self.board = [[0] * Tetris.BOARD_WIDTH for _ in range(Tetris.BOARD_HEIGHT)]
        self.game_over = False
        self.bag = list(range(len(Tetris.TETROMINOS)))
        random.shuffle(self.bag)
        self.next_piece = self.bag.pop()
        self._new_round()
        self.score = 0
        return self._get_board_props(self.board)
```
- **Purpose:** Resets the game state, initializes the board, shuffles the tetromino bag, and prepares for a new round.

### Tetromino and Board Operations
#### Get Rotated Piece
```python
    def _get_rotated_piece(self):
        '''Returns the current piece, including rotation'''
        return Tetris.TETROMINOS[self.current_piece][self.current_rotation]
```
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the current piece in its current rotation.

#### Get Complete Board
```python
    def _get_complete_board(self):
        '''Returns the complete board, including the current piece'''
        piece = self._get_rotated_piece()
        piece = [np.add(x, self.current_pos) for x in piece]
        board = [x[:] for x in self.board]
        for x, y in piece:
            board[y][x] = Tetris.MAP_PLAYER
        return board
```
- **Purpose:** Generates the board with the current piece placed.

### Score Management
```python
    def get_game_score(self):
        '''Returns the current game score.'''
        return self.score
```
- **Purpose:** Returns the current score, considering blocks placed and lines cleared.

### New Round Initialization
```python
    def _new_round(self):
        '''Starts a new round (new piece)'''
        if len(self.bag) == 0:
            self.bag = list(range(len(Tetris.TETROMINOS)))
            random.shuffle(self.bag)

        self.current_piece = self.next_piece
        self.next_piece = self.bag.pop()
        self.current_pos = [3, 0]
        self.current_rotation = 0

        if self._check_collision(self._get_rotated_piece(), self.current_pos):
            self.game_over = True
```
- **Purpose:** Prepares a new tetromino, checking for game over conditions.

### Collision Detection
```python
    def _check_collision(self, piece, pos):
        '''Check if there is a collision between the current piece and the board'''
        for x, y in piece:
            x += pos[0]
            y += pos[1]
            if x < 0 or x >= Tetris.BOARD_WIDTH \
                    or y < 0 or y >= Tetris.BOARD_HEIGHT \
                    or self.board[y][x] == Tetris.MAP_BLOCK:
                return True
        return False
```
- **Purpose:** Determines if the current piece collides with the board boundaries or filled cells.

### Rotation Management
```python
    def _rotate(self, angle):
        '''Change the current rotation'''
        r = self.current_rotation + angle
        ...
        self.current_rotation = r
```
- **Purpose:** Adjusts the current rotation of the piece based on the specified angle.

### Piece Placement
```python
    def _add_piece_to_board(self, piece, pos):
        '''Place a piece in the board, returning the resulting board'''        
        board = [x[:] for x in self.board]
        for x, y in piece:
            board[y + pos[1]][x + pos[0]] = Tetris.MAP_BLOCK
        return board
```
- **Purpose:** Places the tetromino on the board at the specified position.

### Line Clearing
```python
    def _clear_lines(self, board):
        '''Clears completed lines in a board'''
        lines_to_clear = [index for index, row in enumerate(board) if sum(row) == Tetris.BOARD_WIDTH]
        ...
        return len(lines_to_clear), board
```
- **Purpose:** Identifies and clears full lines, returning the number of cleared lines.

### Board Properties Calculation
```python
    def _get_board_props(self, board):
        '''Get properties of the board'''
        lines, board = self._clear_lines(board)
        holes = self._number_of_holes(board)
        total_bumpiness, max_bumpiness = self._bumpiness(board)
        sum_height, max_height, min_height = self._height(board)
        return [lines, holes, total_bumpiness, sum_height]
```
- **Purpose:** Computes key metrics of the board that can be useful for evaluating the game state.

### State Management
```python
    def get_next_states(self):
        '''Get all possible next states'''
        states = {}
        ...
        return states
```
- **Purpose:** Determines all valid positions and rotations for the current piece, returning their corresponding board states.

### State Size
```python
    def get_state_size(self):
        '''Size of the state'''
        return 4
```
- **Purpose:** Returns the size of the state representation, which could be used for input to a neural network.

### Playing the Game
```python
    def play(self, x, rotation, render=False, render_delay=None):
        '''Makes a play given a position and a rotation, returning the reward and if the game is over'''
        ...
        return score, self.game_over
```
- **Purpose:** Executes the placement of the current piece on the board, updates the game state, and checks for game over conditions.

### Rendering the Game
```python
    def render(self):
        '''Renders the current board using Pygame'''
        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the screen
        ...
        pygame.display.flip()
```
- **Purpose:** Draws the game board and current pieces on the screen, handling Pygame events.

### Example Usage
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tetris_game = Tetris()
    while not tetris_game.game_over:
        tetris_game.render()
        sleep(0.5)  # Simulate some delay
```
- **Purpose:** Instantiates the Tetris game and enters the main game loop, rendering the game continuously until itâ€™s over.
